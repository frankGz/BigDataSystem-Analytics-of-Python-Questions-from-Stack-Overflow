before running the app

please create /app/Documents/EECS4415_project director in the docker environment
and put everything in the zip file into that folder.

part a:
1. install all the python pacakges requeired by part_a
2. enter "spark-submit part_a.py" to get two figures and two csv files.

part b:
1. install all the python pacakges requeired by part_b
2. enter "spark-submit part_b_query_data.py 'question_string'" to get the top 10 user ids based on the cos similarity.

because the data set is large, it may take long time to finish, better to take first 2000 rows from the id_features/part-00000 file
